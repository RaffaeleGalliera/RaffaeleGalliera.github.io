I am a passionate researcher with a focus on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for optimizing communication networks and learning communication protocols.

While focusing on my Ph.D. I also intern as a Research Assistant at the NOMADS Lab (IHMC), where communication protocols and engineering solutions are designed for challenged networking environments.
During my master's degree, in 2021,  I served as vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics group (AIDA) at UWF. We placed 3rd at the  <a href='https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Blogs/Detail/Article/2570693/artificial-intelligence-tracks-at-sea-challenge-prairie-view-am-university-a-hi/'>nationwide AI Tracks at Sea competition</a> organized by the NIWC Pacific. 
During the second year of my Ph.D.  I presented our work on designing and training Reinforcement Learning agents for Congestion Control in Real Networks at the  <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/rlready4prodworkshop/home'> AAAI 2023 Reinforcement Learning Ready for Production workshop</a> .

My academic journey began at the University of Ferrara, where I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering. A double degree program in Computer Science between the University of Ferrara and the University of West Florida led me to complete my Master of Science in Computer Science at UWF. After my Master's Degree, I embarked on my Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems and Robotics, a joint program between IHMC and UWF, under the advice of Dr. Niranjan Suri and Dr. Kristen Brent Venable.
