I am a passionate researcher with a focus on multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for optimizing communication networks and learning communication protocols.

While focusing on my Ph.D. I also intern as a Research Assistant at the NOMADS Lab (IHMC), where communication protocols and engineering solutions are designed for challenged networking environments.
During my master's degree, in 2021,  I served as vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics group (AIDA) at UWF. We placed 3rd at the  <a href='https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Blogs/Detail/Article/2570693/artificial-intelligence-tracks-at-sea-challenge-prairie-view-am-university-a-hi/'>nationwide AI Tracks at Sea competition</a> organized by the NIWC Pacific. 

In 2023, I first-authored publications on single and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and presented at the <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/rlready4prodworkshop/home'>AAAI 2023 Reinforcement Learning Ready for Production Workshop</a> and at the <a href='mlforsystems.org'> NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Machine Learning for Systems</a>.
I have also been accepted at the <a href='https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/dc-24-program/'>29th AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium</a> at AAAI 2024, where I presented my research on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Communication Networks.

From April until October 2024 I participated in a 6-months internship for Apple, working on single and multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for the Wireless Technologies and Ecosystems team in San Diego.

My academic journey began at the University of Ferrara, where I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Computer Science Engineering. A double degree program in Computer Science between the University of Ferrara and the University of West Florida led me to complete my Master of Science in Computer Science at UWF. After my Master's Degree, I embarked on my Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems and Robotics, a joint program between IHMC and UWF, under the advice of <a href='https://www.ihmc.us/groups/nsuri/'>Dr. Niranjan Suri</a> and <a href='https://www.ihmc.us/groups/bvenable/'>Dr. Kristen Brent Venable</a>.
